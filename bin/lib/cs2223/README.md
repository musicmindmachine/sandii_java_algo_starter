# cs2223

Code resources for CS 2223 Algorithms. These can only be accessed (for now) from the WPI network or by using Global Protect VPN to connect from off campus.

The "Algorithms D2023" folder is an Eclipse project that can be imported right from the git repository in several ways:

* In Eclipse, clone the git repository "https://gitlab03.wpi.edu/heineman/cs2223.git" and then you can import the project "Algorithms D2023" into your Eclipse workspace.

* From the command line, just clone the repository onto your computer via "git clone https://gitlab03.wpi.edu/heineman/cs2223.git"" and the you can import this location into Eclipse or IntelliJ or whatever IDE you are using.

In both case, you are responsible for synchronizing the repository daily by using "pull ..." command to get latest changes.
